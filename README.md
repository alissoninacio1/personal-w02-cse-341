## Introduction
This project aims to create a Node.js application that handles HTTP requests, connects to a MongoDB database, and documents the API using Swagger. By the end of this assignment, you will have a fully functional API with interactive Swagger documentation.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Create a Node.js project for handling HTTP requests.
- Establish a MongoDB database with a collection named "contacts."
- Ensure the project runs without errors on Render.
- Construct API documentation using Swagger, covering routes for GET all, GET by ID, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, you will complete your Contacts project, which involves creating RESTful API routes in Node.js to interact with a MongoDB database. You will also document your API using Swagger. Here are the steps to complete this task:

1. Review the project requirements and grading rubric.
2. Create Swagger documentation for your API project, utilizing the packages mentioned and used in the team activity.
3. Test your Swagger documentation routes with your published API (not on localhost) to ensure they work as expected.
4. Push any changes to your GitHub repository and verify them on Render.
5. Ensure that your published project includes an "/api-docs" route with the interactive Swagger GUI.
6. Record a brief video demonstration showing you successfully using the Swagger documentation to send requests to each API route. Use your Render URL for this purpose. Additionally, provide evidence that your database is being updated. Note that using localhost in the video will result in point deductions, as indicated in the rubric.
7. Push your changes to GitHub.
8. Publish your project to Render.
9. Create a brief video demonstrating the functionality of your assignment and upload it to YouTube (public or unlisted).
10. Submit the following links in I-Learn: GitHub repository, Render URL, and YouTube video.

## Extra Credit Opportunity
You have the chance to earn an additional 10% added to your project grade by demonstrating the successful usage of a frontend project that interacts with your backend API. This React Application, created to work with your Contacts project, performs all the API requests/routes with a GUI. To achieve this extra credit, follow the instructions provided in the video.

## Full Stack Project Overview
This project provides an opportunity to understand how a backend project works within a fullstack project. The React Application mentioned earlier can be used to interact with your Contacts project. It mimics all the API requests and routes but with a graphical user interface (GUI). As a stretch challenge, you can test your published API with this website. Refer to the provided video for more details and any additional steps required to make it work seamlessly with your backend API.
