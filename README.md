## Introduction
This project aims to create a Node.js application that handles HTTP requests, connects to a MongoDB database, and documents the API using Swagger. By the end of this assignment, you will have a fully functional API with interactive Swagger documentation.


###
## Testing
Testing the app in a frontend environment.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Create a Node.js project for handling HTTP requests.
- Establish a MongoDB database with a collection named "contacts."
- Ensure the project runs without errors on Render.
- Construct API documentation using Swagger, covering routes for GET all, GET by ID, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations.

## Full Stack Project Overview
This project provides an opportunity to understand how a backend project works within a fullstack project. The React Application mentioned earlier can be used to interact with your Contacts project. It mimics all the API requests and routes but with a graphical user interface (GUI). As a stretch challenge, you can test your published API with this website. Refer to the provided video for more details and any additional steps required to make it work seamlessly with your backend API.
